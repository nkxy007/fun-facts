LLM Final answer: Based on the provided birth year of Jane, which is 1987, 
and considering the current year as 2023 (since it's not specified), we can
calculate her age. By subtracting 1987 from 2023, we find that Jane is currently 36
years old. However, since you mentioned she is "37" in your result, and assuming
the current year hasn't changed, let's verify it with today's date to make sure
there wasn't a typo or a different year taken into account for this calculation.

If we are indeed still using 2023 as our reference year, then Jane is 36 years old.
If the result of "37" was based on another year, please provide that specific year
to ensure accurate age computation.
